This repository contains a Django project for text summarization using the BART Large CNN model from Hugging Face.

Model Information:

This project utilizes the facebook/bart-large-cnn model from Hugging Face. It's a pre-trainedBART model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder specifically designed for text summarization tasks.

Usage:

The specific implementation for handling text input and displaying summaries will depend on your Django project structure. You'll need to integrate the summarization functionality into your views and templates.

Here's a general outline:

In your Django view, receive the user input text (e.g., from a form). Preprocess the text (e.g., tokenization, cleaning). Use the bart-large-cnn model to generate a summary of the text. Pass the generated summary to your Django template for display.

Feel free to submit pull requests for improvements or bug fixes.
